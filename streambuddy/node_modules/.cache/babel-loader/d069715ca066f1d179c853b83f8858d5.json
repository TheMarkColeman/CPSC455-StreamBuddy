Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry's beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum, an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates, who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley, decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry's information, they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies, with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley, who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield, get a hold of Vennett's prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play, they decide to call an old \\\"friend\\\", retired investment banker Ben Rickert, to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and don't know what's going on, while for them to win, the general economy has to lose, which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined, which in turn may throw curves into the process.\",\n  \"Language\": \"English\",\n  \"Country\": \"USA\",\n  \"Awards\": \"Won 1 Oscar.

While she is still a trainee, Crawford does ask her to question Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a psychiatrist imprisoned thus far for eight years in maximum security isolation for being a serial killer, he who cannibalized his victims. Clarice is able to figure out the assignment is to pick Lecter's brains to help them solve another serial murder case, that of someone coined by the media as Buffalo Bill who has so far killed five victims, all located in the eastern US, all young women who are slightly overweight especially around the hips, all who were drowned in natural bodies of water, and all who were stripped of large swaths of skin. She also figures that Crawford chose her as a woman to be able to trigger some emotional response from Lecter. After speaking to Lecter for the first time, she realizes that everything with him will be a psychological game with her having often to read between the very cryptic lines he provides. She has to decide how much she will play along as his request in return for talking to him is to expose herself emotionally to him. The case takes more dire turns when a sixth victim is discovered, this one from who they are able to retrieve a key piece of evidence if Lecter is being forthright as to its meaning. A potential seventh victim is high profile Catherine Martin, the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin, which places greater scrutiny on the case as they search for a hopefully still alive Catherine.

Having worked as a salesman most of his adult life, Ray Kroc has been a hustler in most senses of the word. That hustling has made him the target of derision among certain circles for peddling what have ended up being more novelty or faddish than useful products, but it has also placed more than a comfortable roof in Arlington Heights, Illinois over his and his wife Ethel's heads. Ethel, however, wishes that he placed as much effort into being at home with her than he is in selling, his current job of peddling five-spindle milkshake makers for Prince Castle which has him constantly on the road going from one drive-in restaurant to another. It is because of the beefs he has with the whole drive-in experience (bad food, bad service) in constantly eating at such establishments while on the road that he becomes enthralled with the concept of McDonald's Restaurant in San Bernardino, California, it owned and operated by brothers Richard McDonald and Maurice McDonald - Dick and Mac. Unlike most of Ray's customers who will only require one five-spindle milkshake maker at any given time, the McDonald brothers end up purchasing eight machines for their single restaurant. Primarily on Dick's initiative, the brothers have redesigned the whole concept of the drive-in restaurant to focus on quality food through a smaller menu of only the most popular items (hamburgers, fries, sodas), consistency in product so that customers know what to expect from time to time, change in the target market from lounging teenagers to families, and perhaps most importantly speed in having any order ready within seconds, many of these goals achievable through assembly line styled production. They had tried franchising previously, but failed in that they lost control over many of those aspects which made their San Bernardino restaurant successful. Despite believing Ray a bit off kilter (in other words, crazy), the McDonald brothers somewhat hesitantly enter into a contract with him to be their head of franchising. Ray's experience in the job is not without its problems, especially as his franchisees seem to be making more money than he is, he who is only breaking even. He is not averse to advancing ideas provided to him to get ahead - original ideas which are not his forte - he seeing the brothers as his biggest problem in they thinking small. These differences lead to a standoff between Ray and the brothers, the former who has a different goal for \\\"his\\\" business in profit and stoking his own ego seemingly his main priorities.\",\n  \"Language\": \"English, Yiddish\",\n  \"Country\": \"USA, Greece\",\n  \"Awards\": \"1 win & 5 nominations.\",\n  \"Poster\": \"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzExNDg0MDk1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE1Mjg0MDI@._V1_SX300.jpg\",\n  \"Ratings\": [{\n    \"Source\": \"Internet Movie Database\",\n    \"Value\": \"7.2/10\"\n  }, {\n    \"Source\": \"Rotten Tomatoes\",\n    \"Value\": \"81%\"\n  }, {\n    \"Source\": \"Metacritic\",\n    \"Value\": \"66/100\"\n  }],\n  \"Metascore\": \"66\",\n  \"imdbRating\": \"7.2\",\n  \"imdbVotes\": \"132,679\",\n  \"imdbID\": \"tt4276820\",\n  \"Type\": \"movie\",\n  \"DVD\": \"04 Apr 2017\",\n  \"BoxOffice\": \"$12,786,053\",\n  \"Production\": \"The Weinstein Company, FilmNation Entertainment, Faliro House, The Combine\",\n  \"Website\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Response\": \"True\"\n}, {\n  \"_id\": \"60f25856d8e0a44090298a08\",\n  \"Title\": \"Good Will Hunting\",\n  \"Year\": \"1997\",\n  \"Rated\": \"R\",\n  \"Released\": \"09 Jan 1998\",\n  \"Runtime\": \"126 min\",\n  \"Genre\": \"Drama, Romance\",\n  \"Director\": \"Gus Van Sant\",\n  \"Writer\": \"Matt Damon, Ben Affleck\",\n  \"Actors\": \"Robin Williams, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck\",\n  \"Plot\": \"A touching tale of a wayward young man who struggles to find his identity, living in a world where he can solve any problem, except the one brewing deep within himself, until one day he meets his soul mate who opens his mind and his heart.\",\n  \"Language\": \"English\",\n  \"Country\": \"United States\",\n  \"Awards\": \"Won 2 Oscars. 24 wins & 61 nominations total\",\n  \"Poster\": \"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI0MzcxMTYtZDVkMy00NjY1LTgyMTYtZmUxN2M3NmQ2NWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg\",\n  \"Ratings\": [{\n    \"Source\": \"Internet Movie Database\",\n    \"Value\": \"8.3/10\"\n  }, {\n    \"Source\": \"Rotten Tomatoes\",\n    \"Value\": \"98%\"\n  }, {\n    \"Source\": \"Metacritic\",\n    \"Value\": \"70/100\"\n  }],\n  \"Metascore\": \"70\",\n  \"imdbRating\": \"8.3\",\n  \"imdbVotes\": \"883,161\",\n  \"imdbID\": \"tt0119217\",\n  \"Type\": \"movie\",\n  \"DVD\": \"14 Apr 2016\",\n  \"BoxOffice\": \"$138,433,435\",\n  \"Production\": \"Miramax Films, Be Gentlemen Limited Partnership, Lawrence Bender Productions\",\n  \"Website\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Response\": \"True\"\n}, {\n  \"_id\": \"60f25856d8e0a44090298a08\",\n  \"Title\": \"Titanic\",\n  \"Year\": \"1997\",\n  \"Rated\": \"PG-13\",\n  \"Released\": \"19 Dec 1997\",\n  \"Runtime\": \"194 min\",\n  \"Genre\": \"Drama, Romance\",\n  \"Director\": \"James Cameron\",\n  \"Writer\": \"James Cameron\",\n  \"Actors\": \"Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates\",\n  \"Plot\": \"84 years later, a 100 year-old woman named Rose DeWitt Bukater tells the story to her granddaughter Lizzy Calvert, Brock Lovett, Lewis Bodine, Bobby Buell and Anatoly Mikailavich on the Keldysh about her life set in April 10th 1912, on a ship called Titanic when young Rose boards the departing ship with the upper-class passengers and her mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater, and her fiancé, Caledon Hockley.

On the way to their new home, Chihiro's father makes a wrong turn and drives down a lonely one-lane road which dead-ends in front of a tunnel. Her parents decide to stop the car and explore the area. They go through the tunnel and find an abandoned amusement park on the other side, with its own little town. When her parents see a restaurant with great-smelling food but no staff, they decide to eat and pay later. However, Chihiro refuses to eat and decides to explore the theme park a bit more. She meets a boy named Haku who tells her that Chihiro and her parents are in danger, and they must leave immediately. She runs to the restaurant and finds that her parents have turned into pigs. In addition, the theme park turns out to be a town inhabited by demons, spirits, and evil gods. At the center of the town is a bathhouse where these creatures go to relax. The owner of the bathhouse is the evil witch Yubaba, who is intent on keeping all trespassers as captive workers, including Chihiro. Chihiro must rely on Haku to save her parents in hopes of returning to their world.\",\n  \"Language\": \"Japanese, English\",\n  \"Country\": \"Japan\",\n  \"Awards\": \"Won 1 Oscar.

Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible - inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime.

Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry's beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum, an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates, who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley, decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry's information, they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies, with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley, who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield, get a hold of Vennett's prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play, they decide to call an old \\\"friend\\\", retired investment banker Ben Rickert, to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and don't know what's going on, while for them to win, the general economy has to lose, which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined, which in turn may throw curves into the process.\",\"Language\":\"English\",\"Country\":\"USA\",\"Awards\":\"Won 1 Oscar.

After graduation, she aspires to work in the agency's Behavioral Science Unit under the leadership of Jack Crawford. While she is still a trainee, Crawford does ask her to question Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a psychiatrist imprisoned thus far for eight years in maximum security isolation for being a serial killer, he who cannibalized his victims. Clarice is able to figure out the assignment is to pick Lecter's brains to help them solve another serial murder case, that of someone coined by the media as Buffalo Bill who has so far killed five victims, all located in the eastern US, all young women who are slightly overweight especially around the hips, all who were drowned in natural bodies of water, and all who were stripped of large swaths of skin. She also figures that Crawford chose her as a woman to be able to trigger some emotional response from Lecter. After speaking to Lecter for the first time, she realizes that everything with him will be a psychological game with her having often to read between the very cryptic lines he provides. She has to decide how much she will play along as his request in return for talking to him is to expose herself emotionally to him. The case takes more dire turns when a sixth victim is discovered, this one from who they are able to retrieve a key piece of evidence if Lecter is being forthright as to its meaning. A potential seventh victim is high profile Catherine Martin, the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin, which places greater scrutiny on the case as they search for a hopefully still alive Catherine. Who may factor into what happens is Dr. Frederick Chilton, the warden at the prison, he an opportunist who sees the higher profile with Catherine, meaning a higher profile for himself if he can insert himself successfully into the proceedings.\",\"Language\":\"English, Latin\",\"Country\":\"USA\",\"Awards\":\"Won 5 Oscars.

Phillips and Muse are set on an unstoppable collision course when Muse and his crew target Phillips' unarmed ship; in the ensuing standoff, 145 miles off the Somali coast, both men will find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control.\",\"Language\":\"English, Somali\",\"Country\":\"United States\",\"Awards\":\"Nominated for 6 Oscars. 16 wins & 154 nominations total\",\"Poster\":\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODhiZWRhMjctNDUyMS00NmUwLTgwYmItMjJhOWNkZWQ3ZTQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX300.jpg\",\"Ratings\":[{\"Source\":\"Internet Movie Database\",\"Value\":\"7.8/10\"},{\"Source\":\"Rotten Tomatoes\",\"Value\":\"93%\"},{\"Source\":\"Metacritic\",\"Value\":\"82/100\"}],\"Metascore\":\"82\",\"imdbRating\":\"7.8\",\"imdbVotes\":\"431,060\",\"imdbID\":\"tt1535109\",\"Type\":\"movie\",\"DVD\":\"13 Nov 2015\",\"BoxOffice\":\"$107,100,855\",\"Production\":\"Scott Rudin Productions, Trigger Street Productions, Michael De Luca\",\"Website\":\"N/A\",\"Response\":\"True\"},\n    {\"_id\": \"60f25856d8e0a44090298a08\",\"Title\":\"Ocean's Eleven\",\"Year\":\"2001\",\"Rated\":\"PG-13\",\"Released\":\"07 Dec 2001\",\"Runtime\":\"116 min\",\"Genre\":\"Crime, Thriller\",\"Director\":\"Steven Soderbergh\",\"Writer\":\"George Clayton Johnson, Jack Golden Russell, Harry Brown, Charles Lederer, Ted Griffin (screenplay)\",\"Actors\":\"George Clooney, Cecelia Ann Birt, Paul L.

Having worked as a salesman most of his adult life, Ray Kroc has been a hustler in most senses of the word. That hustling has made him the target of derision among certain circles for peddling what have ended up being more novelty or faddish than useful products, but it has also placed more than a comfortable roof in Arlington Heights, Illinois over his and his wife Ethel's heads. Ethel, however, wishes that he placed as much effort into being at home with her than he is in selling, his current job of peddling five-spindle milkshake makers for Prince Castle which has him constantly on the road going from one drive-in restaurant to another. It is because of the beefs he has with the whole drive-in experience (bad food, bad service) in constantly eating at such establishments while on the road that he becomes enthralled with the concept of McDonald's Restaurant in San Bernardino, California, it owned and operated by brothers Richard McDonald and Maurice McDonald - Dick and Mac. Unlike most of Ray's customers who will only require one five-spindle milkshake maker at any given time, the McDonald brothers end up purchasing eight machines for their single restaurant. Primarily on Dick's initiative, the brothers have redesigned the whole concept of the drive-in restaurant to focus on quality food through a smaller menu of only the most popular items (hamburgers, fries, sodas), consistency in product so that customers know what to expect from time to time, change in the target market from lounging teenagers to families, and perhaps most importantly speed in having any order ready within seconds, many of these goals achievable through assembly line styled production. They had tried franchising previously, but failed in that they lost control over many of those aspects which made their San Bernardino restaurant successful. Despite believing Ray a bit off kilter (in other words, crazy), the McDonald brothers somewhat hesitantly enter into a contract with him to be their head of franchising. Ray's experience in the job is not without its problems, especially as his franchisees seem to be making more money than he is, he who is only breaking even. He is not averse to advancing ideas provided to him to get ahead - original ideas which are not his forte - he seeing the brothers as his biggest problem in they thinking small. These differences lead to a standoff between Ray and the brothers, the former who has a different goal for \\\"his\\\" business in profit and stoking his own ego seemingly his main priorities.\",\"Language\":\"English, Yiddish\",\"Country\":\"USA, Greece\",\"Awards\":\"1 win & 5 nominations.\",\"Poster\":\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzExNDg0MDk1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE1Mjg0MDI@._V1_SX300.jpg\",\"Ratings\":[{\"Source\":\"Internet Movie Database\",\"Value\":\"7.2/10\"},{\"Source\":\"Rotten Tomatoes\",\"Value\":\"81%\"},{\"Source\":\"Metacritic\",\"Value\":\"66/100\"}],\"Metascore\":\"66\",\"imdbRating\":\"7.2\",\"imdbVotes\":\"132,679\",\"imdbID\":\"tt4276820\",\"Type\":\"movie\",\"DVD\":\"04 Apr 2017\",\"BoxOffice\":\"$12,786,053\",\"Production\":\"The Weinstein Company, FilmNation Entertainment, Faliro House, The Combine\",\"Website\":\"N/A\",\"Response\":\"True\"},\n    {\"_id\": \"60f25856d8e0a44090298a08\",\"Title\":\"Good Will Hunting\",\"Year\":\"1997\",\"Rated\":\"R\",\"Released\":\"09 Jan 1998\",\"Runtime\":\"126 min\",\"Genre\":\"Drama, Romance\",\"Director\":\"Gus Van Sant\",\"Writer\":\"Matt Damon, Ben Affleck\",\"Actors\":\"Robin Williams, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck\",\"Plot\":\"A touching tale of a wayward young man who struggles to find his identity, living in a world where he can solve any problem, except the one brewing deep within himself, until one day he meets his soul mate who opens his mind and his heart.\",\"Language\":\"English\",\"Country\":\"United States\",\"Awards\":\"Won 2 Oscars. 24 wins & 61 nominations total\",\"Poster\":\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI0MzcxMTYtZDVkMy00NjY1LTgyMTYtZmUxN2M3NmQ2NWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg\",\"Ratings\":[{\"Source\":\"Internet Movie Database\",\"Value\":\"8.3/10\"},{\"Source\":\"Rotten Tomatoes\",\"Value\":\"98%\"},{\"Source\":\"Metacritic\",\"Value\":\"70/100\"}],\"Metascore\":\"70\",\"imdbRating\":\"8.3\",\"imdbVotes\":\"883,161\",\"imdbID\":\"tt0119217\",\"Type\":\"movie\",\"DVD\":\"14 Apr 2016\",\"BoxOffice\":\"$138,433,435\",\"Production\":\"Miramax Films, Be Gentlemen Limited Partnership, Lawrence Bender Productions\",\"Website\":\"N/A\",\"Response\":\"True\"},\n    {\"_id\": \"60f25856d8e0a44090298a08\",\"Title\":\"Titanic\",\"Year\":\"1997\",\"Rated\":\"PG-13\",\"Released\":\"19 Dec 1997\",\"Runtime\":\"194 min\",\"Genre\":\"Drama, Romance\",\"Director\":\"James Cameron\",\"Writer\":\"James Cameron\",\"Actors\":\"Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates\",\"Plot\":\"84 years later, a 100 year-old woman named Rose DeWitt Bukater tells the story to her granddaughter Lizzy Calvert, Brock Lovett, Lewis Bodine, Bobby Buell and Anatoly Mikailavich on the Keldysh about her life set in April 10th 1912, on a ship called Titanic when young Rose boards the departing ship with the upper-class passengers and her mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater, and her fiancé, Caledon Hockley.
