# CPSC455-StreamBuddy

## Project Desciption
***Who is it for?***  
Anyone who likes to watch movies / TV shows using online streaming platforms.

***What will it do? (What "human activity" will it support?)***  
Recommend the user which movies to watch on the streaming platform on their choice based on their search criteria. 

Users can search movies by title, genre, rating, genre, release date, director, producer, actor, duration.

Users can create an account and make their profile private or public. Users can add previously watched movies to their watched list and add films they would like to watch to their watch list. 

***What type of data will it store?***  
List of movie data (name, producer, rating, duration, actors etc.) on various streaming services based on geographical location.
User account information (credentials, preferences, and watch list).

***What will users be able to do with this data?***  
Determine what to watch, through more detailed filters and visibility into content catalogues. 

***What is some additional functionality you can add/remove based on time constraints?***  
We’ll initially focus on Netflix but hope to include additional streaming platforms such as Amazon Prime, Hulu and Crave. 


## Project Task Requirements
***3-5 minimal requirements (will definitely complete):***  
1. Search all movie information on a movie database (IMDB / The Movie Database / Rotten Tomatoes) via their API.
2. Allow users to select filters (filter e.g. genre, release year, actor, producer, director, streaming service, min / max duration)
3. Match up filtered results to movies available on Netflix (country specific as min requirement)
4. Responsive UI (Intuitive interface that works across all devices), content displays properly on various screen sizes.
  
***3-7 "standard" requirements (will most likely complete):***  
1. Create a user profile and manage login credentials.
2. User can save which movies they have already watched and would like to watch (watch list)
3. Give a user an option in search criteria to omit previously watched movies from search results.
4. Users can rate movies.
5. Users can post reviews.

***2-3 stretch requirements (plan to complete at least 1!):***  
1. Pull watch history from a user’s Netflix, Crave, etc. accounts for more detailed recommendations.
2. Add other streaming services and their media onto our product (e.g. Amazon Prime, Hulu, Crave, etc.)
3. Users can follow friends (similar to letterboxed) and view their watch-list history if the followed user has made it public.
